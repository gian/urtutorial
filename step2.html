<h1>Ur/Web Tutorial</h1>

<h2>Step 2</h2>

<p>OK, so we succeeded in getting an application running, but it didn't really <em>do</em> much.  In this step we are going to add a database and have two different views on the same data.</p>

<h2>Table Schema</h2>

<p>We now consider exactly what it is we wish to store in our database.  We're building a blog system, so my approximation of useful properties of interest is:</p>

<ul>
<li>A unique identifier</li>
<li>Entry title</li>
<li>Entry date</li>
<li>Entry author</li>
<li>Entry body text</li>
</ul>

We return now to our <span class="code">urblog.ur</span> source file.

<h3>urblog.ur</h3>

<pre class="code">
table t : { Id : int, Title : string, Created : time, Author : string, Body : string }
  PRIMARY KEY Id
</pre>

<p>Tables are exist as primitive entities in Ur/Web, which is one of the features that permits it to enforce such stringent checks on your programs.  For anyone who has struggled through the kinds of web programming where SQL queries are represented as non-semantic strings and in which databases and programs need not agree on their structure, this might come as a refreshing surprise.</p>

<p>With this in mind, we have defined a table 'entry', with some fields.  Note that the capitalisation of these field names is significant.  Field names start with upper-case letters.</p>

<p>So, we have a table.  Now we can construct a function that will query and list all of the entries in this table:</p>

<pre class="code">
fun list () =
   rows &lt;- queryX (SELECT * FROM entry)
      (fn row =&gt; 
          &lt;xml&gt;
            &lt;div&gt;
              &lt;h1&gt;{[row.Entry.Title]}&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
              &lt;h2&gt;By {[row.Entry.Author]} at {[row.Entry.Created]}&lt;/h2&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;{[row.Entry.Body]}&lt;/p&gt;
           &lt;/div&gt;
         &lt;/xml&gt;
      );
    return 
      &lt;xml&gt;
        &lt;head&gt;
         &lt;title&gt;All Entries&lt;/title&gt;
        &lt;/head&gt;
        &lt;body&gt;
          &lt;h1&gt;All Entries&lt;/h1&gt;
          {rows}
        &lt;/body&gt;
      &lt;/xml&gt;
</pre>

<p>If you're reasonably comfortable with <span class="code">map</span>, then our definition of <span class="code">viewAll</span> using <span class="code">queryX</span> should make a reasonable amount of sense.  It takes as its two arguments an SQL query and a function that knows how to turn result rows into XML fragments.  We complicate things slightly because we bind the result of this to <em>rows</em> so that we can display it inside a custom XML fragment, which we do by applying sequencing (;) and returning rows inside our custom XML fragment.</p>

<p>Once again, if you're familiar with languages where SQL queries are just strings, you'll be pleasantly surprised to find that Ur/Web ensures that your SQL is well-formed and supplies a DBMS-agnostic syntax.</p>

<h3>urblog.urs</h3>

<p>We need to add our newly defined 'list' function to the signature for our Urblog application, giving it the type for top-level pages that take no parameters:</p>

<pre class="code">
val list : unit -&gt; transaction page
val main : unit -&gt; transaction page
</pre>

<h3>urblog.urp</h3>

<p>We need to configure our database, and where the SQL file that Ur/Web will generate will go:</p>

<pre class="code">
database dbname=urblog
sql urblog.sql

urblog
</pre>

<p>The newline before enumerating the filename prefixes is signficant.</p>
