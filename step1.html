<h1>Ur/Web Tutorial</h1>

<h2>Step 1</h2>
<p><a href="index.html">Previous</a> | <a href="step2.html">Next</a></p>

<p>We're going to create a directory <span class="code">urblog</span> for our project, and in it we will create three (empty) files:

<pre class="code">
urblog/
   urblog.urp
   urblog.urs
   urblog.ur
</pre>

Now, to add some content to these files!</p>

<h3>urblog.urp</h3>

<p>
A <span class="code">.urp</span> file describes the files to be included within our project.  In this case, we just want to ensure that our main source file <span class="code">urblog.ur</span> and its signature definition file <span class="code">urblog.urs</span> are included:

<pre class="code">
urblog
</pre>

No file extensions are necesary here -- the use of a filename prefix such as this one causes the inclusion of the appropriate .ur and .urs files.</p>

<h3>urblog.urs</h3>

<p>
A <span class="code">.urs</span> file is a <em>signature definition</em> that describes what artifacts of our implementation will be visible to the outside world:

<pre class="code">
val main : unit -> transaction page
</pre>

We start by defining only a single function <span class="code">main</span> that will be visible.  It takes as input values of type <span class="code">unit</span> and returns a value of type <span class="code">transaction page</span>.  We'll describe what exactly that means a little later.</p>

<h3>urblog.ur</h3>
<p>
The <span class="code">.ur</span> file holds actual implementation code.  According to the signature we provided in <span class="code">urblog.urs</span>, we are obligated to provide a function called <span class="code">main</span>, so let's go ahead and do that:

<pre class="code">
fun main () = return &lt;xml&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;UrBlog&lt;/title&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;

  &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;h1&gt;UrBlog&lt;/h1&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/xml&gt;
</pre>

If you're used to working in a programming language that treats HTML and XML as strings, then this might look a little surprising.  Within Ur/Web, XML fragments such as these are first-class values (in exactly the same way as integers, strings or booleans might be).  The use of <span class="code">return</span> takes us back to the use of the type <span class="code">transaction page</span> earlier.  The XML fragment has the type <span class="code">page</span>, and <span class="code">return</span> makes this expression part of a transaction, which is a monad in the style of the Haskell IO monad.

</p>

<h2>Putting it all together</h2>

<p>OK, so we've got our source files.  You can compile it all by running:

<pre class="code">
urweb urblog
</pre>

from inside the urblog directory.  This should result in a binary called <span class="code">urblog.exe</span>.</p>
<p>If your system is anything like mine, you can run this binary using a command like <span>./urblog.exe</span>, which results in output such as:

<pre class="code">
urblog # ./urblog.exe 
Database connection initialized.
Listening on port 8080....
Database connection initialized.
Database connection initialized.
</pre>

Marvelous!  The stand-alone webserver associated with your application is now listening for connections on port 8080.  The exact URL is munged slightly by Ur/Web, such that your module name with the first letter upper-cased is the first URI component, followed by the name of any function that is visible outside the module (i.e. roughtly any appropriately-typed functions that are included in the <span class="code">urblog.urs</span> file, or any appropriate-typed functions that these depend upon).  Putting it all together, we can access our application's main function at this URL:</p>
<p><a href="http://localhost:8080/Urblog/main">http://localhost:8080/Urblog/main</a></p>
<p>(Note: This is a localhost URL.  You must have the server running on your local machine, and have appropriate firewall/connection settings to permit you to make a connection to your local machine on port 8080).</p>
<p>If all of that worked, you should see a not-particularly-exciting web application featuring the word 'UrBlog' on a blank page.  If it didn't work, you might have done something wrong, or there could be something wrong with your configuration.  Now might be a good time to join the #ur IRC channel on Freenode.</p>
