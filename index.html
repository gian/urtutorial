<h1>Ur/Web Tutorial</h1>
<h2>Gian Perrone - April 2011</h2>
<p>
This is an introductory tutorial designed to get you started constructing applications in <a href="http://www.impredicative.com/ur">Ur/Web</a>, a modern, functional language for constructing web applications.  This tutorial takes the form of an example application, and a guide explaining the steps of construction.
</p>
<h2>The Application</h2>
<p>We're going to construct a very simple blog system.  It doesn't aim to be particularly functional; rather, we aim only to construct something that will demonstrate enough of the features (and ultimate value) of Ur/Web.  This system is known as 'UrBlog'.

<h2>Installing Ur/Web</h2>
<p>You're going to require a working installation of Ur/Web before you can actually run the examples.  This is basically a matter of downloading Ur/Web, building, and then installing.  There can be some subtleties in the build process, however.  The actual installation process is outside the scope of this tutorial, so if you don't have a working installation already, you should read the <a href="http://www.impredicative.com/ur/">Ur/Web site</a>, particularly the <em>Reference Manual</em>, which should probably be your first port of call when any confusion arises.
</p>

<h2>Prerequisites</h2>
<p>If you've never touched a functional programming language, particularly a strongly typed language such as ML or Haskell, you're probably not going to be able to follow this tutorial.  I would recommend learning something about one (or both) of those languages first, and then returning to Ur/Web.</p>
