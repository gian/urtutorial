<h1>Ur/Web Tutorial</h1>

<h2>Step 3</h2>

<p>In the last step we succeeded in querying the database and displaying it.  If you didn't go to the trouble of adding some test data to your entry table, you'll want to do this now, because in this step we are going to add a little bit of style.</p>

<p>Adding some data is pretty simple.  Ur/Web does some automatic table name generation.  Looking inside the <span class="code">urblog</span> database, there is one table: <span class="code">uw_Urblog_entry</span>.  Tables are named according to the modules they belong to (and module names are in turn defined by file names -- our <span class="code">entry</span> table is defined inside a file called <span class="code">urblog.ur</span>, which leads to an implied module <span class="code">Urblog</span>).  This separation is used by Ur/Web to achieve useful encapsulation of tables, such that one module cannot (inadvertantly or intentionally) interfere with tables that are owned by some other module.  I added some test data like this:</p>

<pre>
insert into uw_Urblog_entry (uw_id, uw_title, uw_created, uw_author, uw_body) values (0, "This is a test entry", now(), "Gian", "This is a test entry.  I hope you like it");
insert into uw_Urblog_entry (uw_id, uw_title, uw_created, uw_author, uw_body) values (1, "This is also a test entry", now(), "Gian", "This is yet another test entry.  I hope you like it");
</pre>

<h3>Stylesheets</h3>

<p>Like most of the other commonly-manipulated artifacts of web development, CSS styles are first-class values in Ur/Web, and therefore the compiler can statically ensure that you do not reference non-existent styles.  Styles are introduced by the <span class="code">style</span> keyword.</p>

<pre class="code">
style entry
</pre>

<p>In <span class="code">urblog.ur</span>, we're going to include a stylesheet, and define a class for our entry div.<p>

<h3>urblog.ur</h3>

<pre class="code">

</pre>
